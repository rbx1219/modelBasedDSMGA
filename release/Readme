======================================
bisection is for finding minimal population size.
Usage: bisection ell numofConvergence lowerBound upperBound

ell: Chromosome length
numofConvergence: number of Convergence. 10 means 10 succuessful convergence out of 10 runs.
lowerBound & upperBound: put -1 if you don't want to bound n.

Things might need be to be modified: 
1) MAX_GEN in bisection.cpp: max number of generations before the GA is considered fail.
2) getMaxFitness() in chromosome.cpp: modify here to return the maximum fitness of a chromosome. This is used to check if the GA succeeds.

--------------------------------------

DSMGA
Usage: DSMGA ell n selectionPressure pc pm maxGen maxFe repeat display rand_seed

ell: Chromosome length
n: Population size
selectionPressure: Selection pressure (tournament size)
pc: Crossover probability
pm: Mutation probability
maxGen: Maximum number of generations (-1 means no limit)
maxFe: Maximan number of function evaluations (-1 means no limit)
repeat: An integer >= 1, number of independent runs.
display: 0 or 1 (1 means showing best chromosome and statistical information)
rand_seed: Random seed (-1 means using time as random seed)


Things might need be to be modified:
1) evaluate() in chromosome.cpp: the Fitness function.
2) getMaxFitness() in chromosome.cpp: modify here to return the maximum fitness of a chromosome. This is used to check if the GA succ
eeds.
3) replacePopulation() in dsmga.cpp: Using RTR or not.
